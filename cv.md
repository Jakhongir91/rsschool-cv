# About me:
Hi there, I am backend developer. I have 5+ year experience in developing backend systems using Laravel, php 7+, redis, Linux, MySql 8 and I always try to learn something new in IT development.
I try to follow SOLID and KISS principles, OOP and Design Patters. I am interested in designing complex projects using architecture based on microservices. At the moment I decided to take RsSchool courses to improve my basic frontend skills to become a fullstack developer.
